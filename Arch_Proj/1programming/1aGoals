1: print contents of file
    1a. A loop going through each character/byte
            check for end of file
        7.a reads every byte, and prints out each single byte
    1b. Print the byte each loop
------------------ DONE! ---------------------------------------



2: print stored data from file
    2a. Creating buffer with appropriate length
            Make sub-file, only goal is:
                get fileD

                NB: test if content is lost on filelength
                get length of fileD
                                
                create new buffer, using length
                
                move contents, to buffer
    GOAL: PRINT BUFFER; with right content inside

    2b. converting one line to data
            Print this data 

    2c. converting all content into data
            print all data
