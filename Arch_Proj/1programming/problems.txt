    OverAll Programming:
        a: input
            a1: how to read file
                    check for an exercise solving this issue
            a2: how to store data, before sorting
                ----Check exercises solving something similar
                    What options do i have for indexing/array- research needed.
                    How to store coordinates together
                        How many bits do they require? - 16 bits twos complement - read up on it, just in case
                        32 bits = 1 pair of coordinates
                    
            a3: the second command line he uses, how to do that?
            a4: 

        b: Sorting numbers
            b1: Which sorting algorithm
            b2: How to iterate through algorithm
            b3: Storing the data being handled

        c: Output
            c1: how to read data
            c2: how to print data
