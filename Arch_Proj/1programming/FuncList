    parseData    -- converts ASCII representation of coordinates into pairs of data

Data:
    allocate  -- retrieves space from OS, to create a buffer, amount is in bytes
    getDesc   -- Reads rdi as a filename, and returns it as a file descriptor

Printing:
    printArg   -- Reads rdi as a string, and prints it's contents
    printFile  -- Reads rdi, as a FileDescriptor, and prints it's contents
    printDchar -- Reads rdi, as a FileDescriptor, and prints out the next byte, returning 0, if no readable bytes
    saveDchar  -- Reads rdi, as a FileDescriptor, and returns the next readable byte, returning amount of bytes read, in r8
    printChar  -- Reads rdi, as a string, and prints the first byte.
