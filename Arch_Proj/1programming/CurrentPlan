2: how to store data, before sorting
        allocate(i), returns a buffer, of length = i*bytes



        I need to know how many coordinates i'm sorting
        Get descriptor

            getLineCount(), reads a filedescriptor, and returns amount of line/coordinates
            also needs to know some size? 
                Assuming its bytes, then i need to count amount of bytes in desc first
                getFileSize(i), reads a descriptor in rdi, and returns size in bytes
            so call getFileSize(Desc)
            
                call getLineCount on descriptor
    

            How much data do i need per coordinate?
            16*amount of lines = i

                Call allocate(i)
